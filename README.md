This is only front-end part i made in Flask. Backend part comming soon.....

# Important!
/*----------------------------Requirement------------------------*/

--> python 3.6 or after 3.6 version

--> flask 1.0 or after 1.0 version

-->Virtual Enviornment  * OPTIONAL *  [ you can create virtual enviornment as your real files are not affected if any changes will made ]


/*--------------------------How to put files-------------------------*/


--> Install virtual enviornment ( pip install virtualenv )

--> Make a folder in your drive. ( mkdir webapp )

--> Create virtual enviornment in your folder. (cd webapp --> virtualenv venv)  * venv is the foldername of virtual enviornment *

--> Then , Go to your venv. In this folder all the packages, framework or all other requirement are there.

--> Then go to your Scripts folder and install flask in that folder. (cd Scripts --> pip install flask )

--> Then install flask-wtf for forms in the same Scripts folder. ( pip install flask-wtf )

--> Make a folder in the venv folder ( mkdir app )  * app is the folder name in venv folder *

--> put all the stuff you made or download i.e. blog.py, forms.py, static folder and templates folder in the app folder



/*----------------------------How to run files in server------------------*/


--> Open your cmd prompt or terminal > go into your venv folder > go into the Scripts folder .

--> Then type activate. Now your virtual enviornment is activated. 

--> Then back to venv folder > go into your app folder > run your blog file. [ Type python Blog.py ]

--> Now you will see a URL of local host with port no. 5000 i.e. http://127.0.0.1:5000/ 

-->Copy and paste that URL into your browser > type home after the slash i.e.  http://127.0.0.1:5000/home > and press enter

--> Now you will see the blog made by me.
